<h1>DOCUMENTING GAMES-BUILDING PROGRESS IN UNREAL ENGINE</h1>

Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Unreal Engine. As this is my first time using any games-engine software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Unreal Engine (UE) for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with game engines but want to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 1</h2>

This is the welcome screen in Unreal Engine. Development will initially be done through Blueprints, UE’s visual coding environment, like Scratch. Click on the Blank option (first option, top-left). Also ensure that the ‘With Starter Content’ option is selected, from the bottom three boxes, below the menu. Note, the ‘With Starter Content’ option box does not light up like the options above. The wording instead toggles between ‘With Starter Content’ and ‘No Starter Content’. Click on Create Project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide1.PNG "Opening and using Unreal Engine")

After clicking ‘Create Project’ this is the screen that appears. This is a barebones environment for development, and further assets for the game, such as characters, fireballs, structures etc. will be initially imported from UE’s wiki repository. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide2.PNG "First Unreal Project")

Organisation is important at the outset itself. Double-click the ‘Starter Content’ folder to reveal the additional folder options. Notice that the folders are arranged in alphabetical order. Right click in the grey area and create a new folder. Label this folder ‘Character’. All character assets will go into this folder. Alternatively, a separate character folder can be created outside the Starter Content folder. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide3.PNG "Organising Folders and Assets")

Once the folders have been setup, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/File:ThirdPerson_FBX.zip and download the zip file. This file contains all the beginners’ assets that will be used in the UE project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide4.PNG "Accessing UE FBX Assets")

Once downloaded and extracted (unzipped) the folder will contain the following assets which will need importing into UE. Ensure, before importing, that the SK_Mannequin asset is included in the list of items. This will be the main character to build, manipulate, and have perform actions within the game environment. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide5.PNG "Unzipping and Installing FBX Assets")

In UE, click on ‘Import’ (in the bottom panel above the folders) and import the SK_Mannequin asset. UE will import the file and open an FBX Import Options dialog box. All options, save for one, can be left to the default. Under the ‘Mesh’ panel, beneath where the ‘Skeleton’ options are, is a small, white arrow. Click this arrow once to reveal the advanced options, and change the ‘Normal Import Method’ dropdown menu from ‘Compute Normals’ to ‘Import Normals’. This is to ensure a smoother character mesh. Click on ‘Import’ at the bottom of the panel, and ignore any warning screens that may pop up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide6.PNG "Importing Assets and Viewing Advanced Options")

This is the screen with the additional options that now displays. The skeleton mesh has been added together with a Physics Asset and an SK Mannequin Skeleton for multiple use when building more than one character. There are also some materials (skins) that are applied to the skeleton mesh. These material options are the spheres displayed in the panel. Double-click on the SK_Mannequin asset (with the pink bar) to view the asset and its properties. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide7.PNG "Accessing Materials Options")

This is the persona window. Hold down Alt and drag along the view screen to see the camera pan across perspectives. Toggle between the ‘mesh’ and ‘Skeleton’ views by choosing the corresponding option from the top right boxes. Each selection opens a new tab, like a browser interface, and reveals the properties for that selection. After exploring these options, close these tabs to return to the main UE screen. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide8.PNG "Mannequins and Personas")

At the main UE screen, create another folder called ‘Animations’ and import all of the remaining FBX assets into this new folder. In the ‘Import Options’ dialog box, there is an option for Skeleton in the drop-down menu. Click on the drop-down menu and choose the skeleton mannequin that was previous imported. This will link the animations to that skeleton mesh. Leave the other options to their default values and click on ‘Import All’. Ignore any warnings that might come up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide9.PNG "Skeleton Mesh")

Once the import is completed, click on the ‘Save All’ button to save all the assets that have been imported. (Any asset with an asterisk sign indicates that asset has yet to be saved). In the ‘Save All’ dialog box, there is a list of assets with a checkbox next to each, providing an option to save all assets or only the ones selected with a check mark. Click on ‘Save All’ to save all the imported assets. Notice the asterisks have disappeared, indicating all assets have been saved. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide10.PNG "Saving Progress")

Persona is UE’s animation editor. It provides animation details and controls over the different animation states. From the Animations folder, double-click on the ‘ThirdPersonIdle’ asset to enter the animation screen and properties panel. The timeline running below shows how the character animates across a specific duration. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide11.PNG "Third person idle state")

The skeleton tree (left pane) contains the entire skeleton hierarchy of the character. Click on any of the joints or sections to highlight that part on the skeleton. Right-clicking on any joint or section and selecting ‘Add Socket’ allows the user to insert an additional holder to place something inside, such as a stick or a weapon. A socket is essentially a placeholder for further assets to sit within. These assets can be added in Blueprints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide12.PNG "Socket Installation")

Toggling between W, E, and R allow the socket to be moved, rotated, and scaled for fine positioning and detailing of the additional asset. Likewise, any existing part of the skeleton can be moved, rotated, and scaled to change the anatomy of the character. Use the middle mouse button to zoom into and out of the skeleton. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide13.PNG "Manipulating Skeleton State")

The options at the top of view screen, ‘Perspective’, ‘Detail Lighting’, ‘Show’, and ‘LOD Auto’, provide additional options to understand the character. These options help to navigate around the character and add or remove information about the character. For example, the ‘Perspective’ option is used to change how the character is viewed, i.e. from the top, left, right, bottom etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide14.PNG "Changing Perspective")

Within the Mesh tab (top right) additional information on clothing, skinning, materials etc is available. Each tab contains its own specific options that correspond to the character, depending on what controls are required over which types of assets, i.e. animation, appearance, anatomy etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide15.PNG "Mesh Tab Information")

Within the animations tab at the bottom, there is an Asset Browser that lists all the animations the character can perform. Double-clicking on each, changes the animation on screen and the character begins performing that particular action. To go back to the initial state, click on the back, white arrow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide16.PNG "Navigating Between Assets")

To setup input settings to control the character, navigate to the main UE screen, then go to Edit > Project Settings. Under the Engine list, there is a link called ‘Input’. Click on the ‘Input’ link, then navigate to the Bindings panel. Click on ‘Axis Mappings’ then open the drop-down arrow that appears. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide17.PNG "Binding Panels")

Rename the Axis Mapping created, from the previous step, to MoveForward and press enter. A new set of drop-downs for controls is generated. Hit the W key to bring up the basic W command key. The W key has now been assigned to forward movement. For reverse movement, create a new drop-down option by clicking the plus symbol, then assign the S key. To make the character move backwards when S is pressed, change the scale value (to the side) to -1.0. Likewise, go ahead and assign the up cursor key and down cursor key to move forward and backward (by changing the scale for the down cursor key to -1.0). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide18.PNG "Moving Forward and Backward")

Likewise, for left and right movement, create a new Axis Mappings, name this MoveRight, and press enter. Create three sub drop-downs, as in the previous step. Assign the D and right cursor key to move right, and the A and left cursor key to move left. Remember to change the scale to -1.0 for the A and left cursor keys. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide19.PNG "Moving Left and Right")

For jumping and punching actions, create new Action Mappings. Note that Axis Mappings provide movement and navigation controls, whereas Action Mappings provide action controls for the character, such as jumping, punching, kicking etc. In this example, the spacebar has been assigned to the jump action, and the left mouse button has been assigned to the punch button. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide20.PNG "Actions and Axis Mapping")

To give a character a new skin or material, right-click in the grey box area then choose the Material option. A new asset box is created next to the spheres. Give it a new, meaningful name that is easy to reference. Double-click the new material instance to open its properties. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide21.PNG "Referencing Materials")

This is the materials editor screen. Right-click on the grid to bring up the context menu, then choose Vectors Parameters. UE will setup a new node with RGB and alpha parameters. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide22.PNG "Vector Parameters")

In the Details panel on the left, rename the parameter to something meaningful. Then navigate to the Material Expression Vector Parameter and choose a colour from the colour picker, in this case a medium red. The Vector Parameter node will now have the new name on the top of its window, and the colour that was picked. If this colour is not showing, make sure that the ‘Live Preview’ box in the top menu bar is selected. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide23.PNG "Colour Pickers")

Dragging a line from the white pin (top) of the base colour node to the Basic Colour pin in the CharacterMaterial panel will update the colour of the material currently assigned to the character. This change is shown in the preview window to the left, where the sphere takes on the new colour. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide24.PNG "Mapping Materials in Blueprints")

To break a link between the nodes, right click on the pin with the joining line and select Break Link(s). This will be particularly useful when working later with Blueprints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide25.PNG "Breaking Blueprints Connections")

In this example, several properties have been used: BaseColour; Fresnel; Power; Lerp; Scalar (Metallic); and Scalar (Roughness). Note the positions of the joins from the pins. These joins tell the story of how the final material has been created, outputted in the preview window on the left. Note also how the material builds itself from the BaseColour panel to the final Character Material panel. When the result is satisfactory, click on ‘Apply’ then ‘Save’ from the top icon menu bar. Then close the materials panel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide26.PNG "Adding Additional Features with Blueprints")

Once the new material has been created, right click the asset then select ‘Create Character Material’. A new asset is created, called ‘CharacterMaterialInstance’. Double-clicking on this new asset brings up the properties panel. This is useful since the properties of the material can be adjusted independently for different characters and objects without going through the process of recreating a new material asset from scratch. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide27.PNG "Instance of Material")

To assign the new character material to the character, double click the character asset box (SK_Mannequin), then tear off the tab so that both the Mesh view as well as the main UE view are visible. Then drag the new material asset from the UE window onto the Material Slots icon (the existing material image). The character is reskinned with the new material. When the result is satisfactory, click the ‘Save’ icon at the top left of the SK_Mannequin window. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide28.PNG "Final Character Materials Map Done")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 2</h2>

Trigger Lighting: In this scene I am creating a trigger area with lighting, which turns on and off as a player enters a specific area. All the actions in this scene are controlled entirely in Blueprints. Since most of this project focuses on familiarity with Blueprints, it is important to know how to navigate to and around this section. In any project window, there is a toolbar at the top with Blueprints as one of the options. Click on Blueprints > Open Level Blueprint to access these controls. Note that in Blueprints, events have a red bar, while functions have a blue bar. This is one way of immediately differentiating between blocks. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide29.PNG "Navigating Blueprints Further")

Start by creating a point light. Click on the pane to the left of the screen, scroll down to Lights, then click and drag a point light onto the scene. The movement (W), rotation (E) and scale (R) can all be manipulated using the defined keyboard shortcuts. Move the light into position. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide30.PNG "Positioning the Light")

Once the light is on the scene, go back to the Blueprints window opened earlier, and right click on the grid. From the pop-up menu, choose the ‘Create a Reference to Point Light’ option. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide31.PNG "Referencing Light Assets")

Notice that a new node for the point light has been created. From this node, a number of connections can be run to other assets to create relationships necessary for the game. An event now has to be created for these relationships to work. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide32.PNG "Positioning the Light")

For ease of reference, it is a good idea to have the two windows side by side. This may be difficult on a smaller screen, but is immensely helpful when developing a game with several Blueprints and references, as I expect to soon enough. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide33.PNG "Side by Side Panels")

Navigate back to the left pane, scroll to Volumes, and choose ‘Trigger Volume’ from the list. Drag this trigger volume box onto the scene. Then right click in the Blueprints window and choose Add Event for Trigger Volume 1 > Collision > Add on Actor Begin Overlap ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide34.PNG "Collision Event")

Notice that a new red node, titled OnActorBeginOverlap (TriggerVolume) has been created in the Blueprint window. This node is an event node; it also has pins which can be connected to the blue lightbulb node (the object node) to establish a relationship. Note also that the pins are colour-coded, which will be useful. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide35.PNG "Red Nodes")

Click on the blue pin of the Point Light and drag out a connector line. From the dialog box that pops up, type ‘visibility’ into the search bar, then click on Toggle Visibility. Two new nodes are created with connector links between them automatically set up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide36.PNG "Connected Light to Event")

I have enlarged the Blueprint window here for easier reference and neatened the layout. Notice that the pins are colour and shape-coded, which makes for easy referencing between how each node’s pins connect to the others. In this case, the red event node, titled (OnActoBeginOverlap) has a white triangular pin, as does the blue function node, titled Toggle Visibility. Drag a connector (execute command) from the red node to the blue node. A relationship has now been created. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide37.PNG "Complete Blueprint of Trigger and Actor Overlap")

Navigate to the main scene window and press the Play button, located at the top of the window. Using the mouse and direction keys on the keyboard, move around the scene. Notice that when the player enters the light area, the light turns on. When the player exits and re-enters the light area, the light turns off. This is the toggle action that has been setup in Blueprints so far. To exit from the live scene and back into editing mode, hit Esc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide38.PNG "Final Scene Created")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 3</h2>

Sliding Doors: In this example I am recreating a scene from scratch, which I learned from YouTube (Virtus Learning Hub). When the player approaches a door, the two glass panes slide away from each other, a light turns on and a sound plays. To create a sliding door, the object of the door has to first be created. In a new project, click on the arrow next to Content, then choose Props > Glass Window. Click and drag the glass window onto the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide39.PNG "Starter Content Assets")

The glass door has been created and is in the scene. The Contents folder has a sub-folder inside titled StarterContent. This is a useful repository of basic items that are found most often in games, and can be used to quickly mock up or prototype a game in Unreal Engine. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide40.PNG "Glass Door")

With the glass window selected, copy-paste the object  (Ctrl + C, then Ctrl + V) to create two glass windows. Together these will act as the glass doors that will slide open and close when an event is triggered. Before that, though, a pivot point needs to be set for the right door, from where the sliding action takes place. Otherwise both doors will slide open in the same direction instead of away from each other. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide41.PNG "Scene Created")

Right click the door, then choose Transform > Mirror Y (to flip it along the Y-axis). The right glass window / door flips over and the two pivot points (one for each door) are now at the far edges and in position. Remember to drag the right door away from the left, since mirroring along the Y-axis will create a perfect overlap with the other door. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide42.PNG "Mirroring")

Both the doors are now in position and ready for further actions. With the basic setup done, additional elements like lighting and door frames can be added from the Content > StarterContent folders. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide43.PNG "Setting Pivot Point")

In this example, I have created a door frame and added a point light. The point light and the sliding doors will be animated using Blueprints. The door frame adds a level of reference and perception to this example. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide44.PNG "Door Frame and Point Light")

The lightbulb intensity has been set to zero, and the colour has been changed to red. These settings can be accessed in the panel on the right, which activates when the object, in this case the lightbulb, has been clicked on. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide45.PNG "Light Intensity")

I am also adding a sound that will be played when the doors open. To access the sounds library, navigate to StarterContent > Audio, then drag an audio file onto the scene. In this example I am going to add the default Starter Music Cue. In the audio panel (which pops up when the audio element is selected) scroll to the Activation section and ensure that Auto Activate is deselected, so that the sound does not start playing as soon as the scene begins, but only when the door opens. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide46.PNG "Sound Asset")

This is the scene all ready and set for Blueprint controls. Add anything else that may make the scene more game-like. For this example, I am going to stick to the sliding doors, lightbulb and audio, as per the tutorial. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide47.PNG "Scene Setup")

Select one of the doors, then go to Cinematics > Add Matinee (Legacy) for the sake of the tutorial. A layers and play-head screen will open. This is where groups can be created, which will then be acted on together in Blueprints. Right click in the darker grey space to the left and select Add Empty Group. Give it an identifying label such as LeftDoor then press enter. Make sure that the door has been selected in the scene before creating the new empty group. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide48.PNG "Setting up Matinee")

Once the layer has been created, a bar will appear across the play area with the name given in the previous step. Right click on the layer and choose Add New Movement Track. Then drag the time bars out or in (at either ends of the frames play area) using the red triangle at the bottom of the extreme right-side bar (hold Alt and move the mouse to zoom out so that the entire timeline fits in the window), to set a duration for the door to move. In this example I have set it to 2 seconds. Once done, press enter to create a new keyframe. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide49.PNG "Amending Time Layers")

The duration of the door’s movement has been set to 2 seconds (from the previous step) and is shown by the green shaded area in the frames play area, bound by the two white lines. Pressing enter, once the duration has been set will create a keyframe at the beginning of the play-head. This keyframe looks like a red triangle. Hold down Ctrl and drag this red triangle out to where the end time bar has been set (in this case 2 seconds). Once done, navigate to the scene, and drag the door using the move command (W) to its open position. Press the Play button at the top of the Matinee window to watch the animation. The door slides open. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide50.PNG "Keyframes for Left Door")

Repeat the process for the RightDoor then press Play in the Matinee window. Now both doors slide away from each other. This is the basic setup for moving the doors. Other properties, such as intensity, transparency, rotation, colour, volume etc. can also be set using keyframes, as demonstrated in the next step, using lighting and sound. This interface is very familiar to users of Adobe AfterEffects or ScreenFlow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide51.PNG "Keyframes for Right Door")
