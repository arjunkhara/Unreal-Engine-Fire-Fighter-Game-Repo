<h1>DOCUMENTING GAMES-BUILDING PROGRESS IN UNREAL ENGINE</h1>

Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Unreal Engine. As this is my first time using any games-engine software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Unreal Engine (UE) for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with game engines but want to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

This is the welcome screen in Unreal Engine. Development will initially be done through Blueprints, UE’s visual coding environment, like Scratch. Click on the Blank option (first option, top-left). Also ensure that the ‘With Starter Content’ option is selected, from the bottom three boxes, below the menu. Note, the ‘With Starter Content’ option box does not light up like the options above. The wording instead toggles between ‘With Starter Content’ and ‘No Starter Content’. Click on Create Project.

After clicking ‘Create Project’ this is the screen that appears. This is a barebones environment for development, and further assets for the game, such as characters, fireballs, structures etc. will be initially imported from UE’s wiki repository. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide2.PNG "First Unreal Project")

Organisation is important at the outset itself. Double-click the ‘Starter Content’ folder to reveal the additional folder options. Notice that the folders are arranged in alphabetical order. Right click in the grey area and create a new folder. Label this folder ‘Character’. All character assets will go into this folder. Alternatively, a separate character folder can be created outside the Starter Content folder. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide3.PNG "Organising Folders and Assets")

Once the folders have been setup, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/File:ThirdPerson_FBX.zip and download the zip file. This file contains all the beginners’ assets that will be used in the UE project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide4.PNG "Accessing UE FBX Assets")

Once downloaded and extracted (unzipped) the folder will contain the following assets which will need importing into UE. Ensure, before importing, that the SK_Mannequin asset is included in the list of items. This will be the main character to build, manipulate, and have perform actions within the game environment. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide5.PNG "Unzipping and Installing FBX Assets")

In UE, click on ‘Import’ (in the bottom panel above the folders) and import the SK_Mannequin asset. UE will import the file and open an FBX Import Options dialog box. All options, save for one, can be left to the default. Under the ‘Mesh’ panel, beneath where the ‘Skeleton’ options are, is a small, white arrow. Click this arrow once to reveal the advanced options, and change the ‘Normal Import Method’ dropdown menu from ‘Compute Normals’ to ‘Import Normals’. This is to ensure a smoother character mesh. Click on ‘Import’ at the bottom of the panel, and ignore any warning screens that may pop up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide6.PNG "Importing Assets and Viewing Advanced Options")

This is the screen with the additional options that now displays. The skeleton mesh has been added together with a Physics Asset and an SK Mannequin Skeleton for multiple use when building more than one character. There are also some materials (skins) that are applied to the skeleton mesh. These material options are the spheres displayed in the panel. Double-click on the SK_Mannequin asset (with the pink bar) to view the asset and its properties. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide7.PNG "Accessing Materials Options")

This is the persona window. Hold down Alt and drag along the view screen to see the camera pan across perspectives. Toggle between the ‘mesh’ and ‘Skeleton’ views by choosing the corresponding option from the top right boxes. Each selection opens a new tab, like a browser interface, and reveals the properties for that selection. After exploring these options, close these tabs to return to the main UE screen. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide8.PNG "Mannequins and Personas")

At the main UE screen, create another folder called ‘Animations’ and import all of the remaining FBX assets into this new folder. In the ‘Import Options’ dialog box, there is an option for Skeleton in the drop-down menu. Click on the drop-down menu and choose the skeleton mannequin that was previous imported. This will link the animations to that skeleton mesh. Leave the other options to their default values and click on ‘Import All’. Ignore any warnings that might come up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide9.PNG "Skeleton Mesh")

Once the import is completed, click on the ‘Save All’ button to save all the assets that have been imported. (Any asset with an asterisk sign indicates that asset has yet to be saved). In the ‘Save All’ dialog box, there is a list of assets with a checkbox next to each, providing an option to save all assets or only the ones selected with a check mark. Click on ‘Save All’ to save all the imported assets. Notice the asterisks have disappeared, indicating all assets have been saved. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide10.PNG "Saving Progress")

Persona is UE’s animation editor. It provides animation details and controls over the different animation states. From the Animations folder, double-click on the ‘ThirdPersonIdle’ asset to enter the animation screen and properties panel. The timeline running below shows how the character animates across a specific duration. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide11.PNG "Third person idle state")

The skeleton tree (left pane) contains the entire skeleton hierarchy of the character. Click on any of the joints or sections to highlight that part on the skeleton. Right-clicking on any joint or section and selecting ‘Add Socket’ allows the user to insert an additional holder to place something inside, such as a stick or a weapon. A socket is essentially a placeholder for further assets to sit within. These assets can be added in Blueprints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide12.PNG "Socket Installation")

Toggling between W, E, and R allow the socket to be moved, rotated, and scaled for fine positioning and detailing of the additional asset. Likewise, any existing part of the skeleton can be moved, rotated, and scaled to change the anatomy of the character. Use the middle mouse button to zoom into and out of the skeleton. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide13.PNG "Manipulating Skeleton State")

The options at the top of view screen, ‘Perspective’, ‘Detail Lighting’, ‘Show’, and ‘LOD Auto’, provide additional options to understand the character. These options help to navigate around the character and add or remove information about the character. For example, the ‘Perspective’ option is used to change how the character is viewed, i.e. from the top, left, right, bottom etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide14.PNG "Changing Perspective")

Within the Mesh tab (top right) additional information on clothing, skinning, materials etc is available. Each tab contains its own specific options that correspond to the character, depending on what controls are required over which types of assets, i.e. animation, appearance, anatomy etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide15.PNG "Mesh Tab Information")

Within the animations tab at the bottom, there is an Asset Browser that lists all the animations the character can perform. Double-clicking on each, changes the animation on screen and the character begins performing that particular action. To go back to the initial state, click on the back, white arrow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide16.PNG "Navigating Between Assets")
