<h1>DOCUMENTING GAMES-BUILDING PROGRESS IN UNREAL ENGINE</h1>

Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Unreal Engine. As this is my first time using any games-engine software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Unreal Engine (UE) for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with game engines but want to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

This is the welcome screen in Unreal Engine. Development will initially be done through Blueprints, UE’s visual coding environment, like Scratch. Click on the Blank option (first option, top-left). Also ensure that the ‘With Starter Content’ option is selected, from the bottom three boxes, below the menu. Note, the ‘With Starter Content’ option box does not light up like the options above. The wording instead toggles between ‘With Starter Content’ and ‘No Starter Content’. Click on Create Project.

After clicking ‘Create Project’ this is the screen that appears. This is a barebones environment for development, and further assets for the game, such as characters, fireballs, structures etc. will be initially imported from UE’s wiki repository. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide2.PNG "First Unreal Project")

Organisation is important at the outset itself. Double-click the ‘Starter Content’ folder to reveal the additional folder options. Notice that the folders are arranged in alphabetical order. Right click in the grey area and create a new folder. Label this folder ‘Character’. All character assets will go into this folder. Alternatively, a separate character folder can be created outside the Starter Content folder. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide3.PNG "Organising Folders and Assets")

Once the folders have been setup, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/File:ThirdPerson_FBX.zip and download the zip file. This file contains all the beginners’ assets that will be used in the UE project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide4.PNG "Accessing UE FBX Assets")

Once downloaded and extracted (unzipped) the folder will contain the following assets which will need importing into UE. Ensure, before importing, that the SK_Mannequin asset is included in the list of items. This will be the main character to build, manipulate, and have perform actions within the game environment. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide5.PNG "Unzipping and Installing FBX Assets")
