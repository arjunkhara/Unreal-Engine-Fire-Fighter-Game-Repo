<h1>DOCUMENTING GAMES-BUILDING PROGRESS IN UNREAL ENGINE</h1>

Hello. I’m Arjun Khara, a student at Goldsmiths College, University of London. This is my introduction to Unreal Engine. As this is my first time using any games-engine software, I will be documenting all my learnings with Unreal Engine (UE) for the purposes of the module, as well as to provide a rudimentary introduction to future students of this module who, like me, have no experience with game engines but want to learn as much and as quickly as possible.

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 1</h2>

This is the welcome screen in Unreal Engine. Development will initially be done through Blueprints, UE’s visual coding environment, like Scratch. Click on the Blank option (first option, top-left). Also ensure that the ‘With Starter Content’ option is selected, from the bottom three boxes, below the menu. Note, the ‘With Starter Content’ option box does not light up like the options above. The wording instead toggles between ‘With Starter Content’ and ‘No Starter Content’. Click on Create Project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide1.PNG "Opening and using Unreal Engine")

After clicking ‘Create Project’ this is the screen that appears. This is a barebones environment for development, and further assets for the game, such as characters, fireballs, structures etc. will be initially imported from UE’s wiki repository. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide2.PNG "First Unreal Project")

Organisation is important at the outset itself. Double-click the ‘Starter Content’ folder to reveal the additional folder options. Notice that the folders are arranged in alphabetical order. Right click in the grey area and create a new folder. Label this folder ‘Character’. All character assets will go into this folder. Alternatively, a separate character folder can be created outside the Starter Content folder. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide3.PNG "Organising Folders and Assets")

Once the folders have been setup, open a web browser and navigate to the following URL: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/File:ThirdPerson_FBX.zip and download the zip file. This file contains all the beginners’ assets that will be used in the UE project. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints-screenshots/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide4.PNG "Accessing UE FBX Assets")

Once downloaded and extracted (unzipped) the folder will contain the following assets which will need importing into UE. Ensure, before importing, that the SK_Mannequin asset is included in the list of items. This will be the main character to build, manipulate, and have perform actions within the game environment. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide5.PNG "Unzipping and Installing FBX Assets")

In UE, click on ‘Import’ (in the bottom panel above the folders) and import the SK_Mannequin asset. UE will import the file and open an FBX Import Options dialog box. All options, save for one, can be left to the default. Under the ‘Mesh’ panel, beneath where the ‘Skeleton’ options are, is a small, white arrow. Click this arrow once to reveal the advanced options, and change the ‘Normal Import Method’ dropdown menu from ‘Compute Normals’ to ‘Import Normals’. This is to ensure a smoother character mesh. Click on ‘Import’ at the bottom of the panel, and ignore any warning screens that may pop up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide6.PNG "Importing Assets and Viewing Advanced Options")

This is the screen with the additional options that now displays. The skeleton mesh has been added together with a Physics Asset and an SK Mannequin Skeleton for multiple use when building more than one character. There are also some materials (skins) that are applied to the skeleton mesh. These material options are the spheres displayed in the panel. Double-click on the SK_Mannequin asset (with the pink bar) to view the asset and its properties. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide7.PNG "Accessing Materials Options")

This is the persona window. Hold down Alt and drag along the view screen to see the camera pan across perspectives. Toggle between the ‘mesh’ and ‘Skeleton’ views by choosing the corresponding option from the top right boxes. Each selection opens a new tab, like a browser interface, and reveals the properties for that selection. After exploring these options, close these tabs to return to the main UE screen. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide8.PNG "Mannequins and Personas")

At the main UE screen, create another folder called ‘Animations’ and import all of the remaining FBX assets into this new folder. In the ‘Import Options’ dialog box, there is an option for Skeleton in the drop-down menu. Click on the drop-down menu and choose the skeleton mannequin that was previous imported. This will link the animations to that skeleton mesh. Leave the other options to their default values and click on ‘Import All’. Ignore any warnings that might come up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide9.PNG "Skeleton Mesh")

Once the import is completed, click on the ‘Save All’ button to save all the assets that have been imported. (Any asset with an asterisk sign indicates that asset has yet to be saved). In the ‘Save All’ dialog box, there is a list of assets with a checkbox next to each, providing an option to save all assets or only the ones selected with a check mark. Click on ‘Save All’ to save all the imported assets. Notice the asterisks have disappeared, indicating all assets have been saved. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide10.PNG "Saving Progress")

Persona is UE’s animation editor. It provides animation details and controls over the different animation states. From the Animations folder, double-click on the ‘ThirdPersonIdle’ asset to enter the animation screen and properties panel. The timeline running below shows how the character animates across a specific duration. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide11.PNG "Third person idle state")

The skeleton tree (left pane) contains the entire skeleton hierarchy of the character. Click on any of the joints or sections to highlight that part on the skeleton. Right-clicking on any joint or section and selecting ‘Add Socket’ allows the user to insert an additional holder to place something inside, such as a stick or a weapon. A socket is essentially a placeholder for further assets to sit within. These assets can be added in Blueprints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide12.PNG "Socket Installation")

Toggling between W, E, and R allow the socket to be moved, rotated, and scaled for fine positioning and detailing of the additional asset. Likewise, any existing part of the skeleton can be moved, rotated, and scaled to change the anatomy of the character. Use the middle mouse button to zoom into and out of the skeleton. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide13.PNG "Manipulating Skeleton State")

The options at the top of view screen, ‘Perspective’, ‘Detail Lighting’, ‘Show’, and ‘LOD Auto’, provide additional options to understand the character. These options help to navigate around the character and add or remove information about the character. For example, the ‘Perspective’ option is used to change how the character is viewed, i.e. from the top, left, right, bottom etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide14.PNG "Changing Perspective")

Within the Mesh tab (top right) additional information on clothing, skinning, materials etc is available. Each tab contains its own specific options that correspond to the character, depending on what controls are required over which types of assets, i.e. animation, appearance, anatomy etc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide15.PNG "Mesh Tab Information")

Within the animations tab at the bottom, there is an Asset Browser that lists all the animations the character can perform. Double-clicking on each, changes the animation on screen and the character begins performing that particular action. To go back to the initial state, click on the back, white arrow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide16.PNG "Navigating Between Assets")

To setup input settings to control the character, navigate to the main UE screen, then go to Edit > Project Settings. Under the Engine list, there is a link called ‘Input’. Click on the ‘Input’ link, then navigate to the Bindings panel. Click on ‘Axis Mappings’ then open the drop-down arrow that appears. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide17.PNG "Binding Panels")

Rename the Axis Mapping created, from the previous step, to MoveForward and press enter. A new set of drop-downs for controls is generated. Hit the W key to bring up the basic W command key. The W key has now been assigned to forward movement. For reverse movement, create a new drop-down option by clicking the plus symbol, then assign the S key. To make the character move backwards when S is pressed, change the scale value (to the side) to -1.0. Likewise, go ahead and assign the up cursor key and down cursor key to move forward and backward (by changing the scale for the down cursor key to -1.0). ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide18.PNG "Moving Forward and Backward")

Likewise, for left and right movement, create a new Axis Mappings, name this MoveRight, and press enter. Create three sub drop-downs, as in the previous step. Assign the D and right cursor key to move right, and the A and left cursor key to move left. Remember to change the scale to -1.0 for the A and left cursor keys. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide19.PNG "Moving Left and Right")

For jumping and punching actions, create new Action Mappings. Note that Axis Mappings provide movement and navigation controls, whereas Action Mappings provide action controls for the character, such as jumping, punching, kicking etc. In this example, the spacebar has been assigned to the jump action, and the left mouse button has been assigned to the punch button. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide20.PNG "Actions and Axis Mapping")

To give a character a new skin or material, right-click in the grey box area then choose the Material option. A new asset box is created next to the spheres. Give it a new, meaningful name that is easy to reference. Double-click the new material instance to open its properties. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide21.PNG "Referencing Materials")

This is the materials editor screen. Right-click on the grid to bring up the context menu, then choose Vectors Parameters. UE will setup a new node with RGB and alpha parameters. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide22.PNG "Vector Parameters")

In the Details panel on the left, rename the parameter to something meaningful. Then navigate to the Material Expression Vector Parameter and choose a colour from the colour picker, in this case a medium red. The Vector Parameter node will now have the new name on the top of its window, and the colour that was picked. If this colour is not showing, make sure that the ‘Live Preview’ box in the top menu bar is selected. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide23.PNG "Colour Pickers")

Dragging a line from the white pin (top) of the base colour node to the Basic Colour pin in the CharacterMaterial panel will update the colour of the material currently assigned to the character. This change is shown in the preview window to the left, where the sphere takes on the new colour. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide24.PNG "Mapping Materials in Blueprints")

To break a link between the nodes, right click on the pin with the joining line and select Break Link(s). This will be particularly useful when working later with Blueprints. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide25.PNG "Breaking Blueprints Connections")

In this example, several properties have been used: BaseColour; Fresnel; Power; Lerp; Scalar (Metallic); and Scalar (Roughness). Note the positions of the joins from the pins. These joins tell the story of how the final material has been created, outputted in the preview window on the left. Note also how the material builds itself from the BaseColour panel to the final Character Material panel. When the result is satisfactory, click on ‘Apply’ then ‘Save’ from the top icon menu bar. Then close the materials panel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide26.PNG "Adding Additional Features with Blueprints")

Once the new material has been created, right click the asset then select ‘Create Character Material’. A new asset is created, called ‘CharacterMaterialInstance’. Double-clicking on this new asset brings up the properties panel. This is useful since the properties of the material can be adjusted independently for different characters and objects without going through the process of recreating a new material asset from scratch. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide27.PNG "Instance of Material")

To assign the new character material to the character, double click the character asset box (SK_Mannequin), then tear off the tab so that both the Mesh view as well as the main UE view are visible. Then drag the new material asset from the UE window onto the Material Slots icon (the existing material image). The character is reskinned with the new material. When the result is satisfactory, click the ‘Save’ icon at the top left of the SK_Mannequin window. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide28.PNG "Final Character Materials Map Done")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 2</h2>

Trigger Lighting: In this scene I am creating a trigger area with lighting, which turns on and off as a player enters a specific area. All the actions in this scene are controlled entirely in Blueprints. Since most of this project focuses on familiarity with Blueprints, it is important to know how to navigate to and around this section. In any project window, there is a toolbar at the top with Blueprints as one of the options. Click on Blueprints > Open Level Blueprint to access these controls. Note that in Blueprints, events have a red bar, while functions have a blue bar. This is one way of immediately differentiating between blocks. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide29.PNG "Navigating Blueprints Further")

Start by creating a point light. Click on the pane to the left of the screen, scroll down to Lights, then click and drag a point light onto the scene. The movement (W), rotation (E) and scale (R) can all be manipulated using the defined keyboard shortcuts. Move the light into position. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide30.PNG "Positioning the Light")

Once the light is on the scene, go back to the Blueprints window opened earlier, and right click on the grid. From the pop-up menu, choose the ‘Create a Reference to Point Light’ option. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide31.PNG "Referencing Light Assets")

Notice that a new node for the point light has been created. From this node, a number of connections can be run to other assets to create relationships necessary for the game. An event now has to be created for these relationships to work. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide32.PNG "Positioning the Light")

For ease of reference, it is a good idea to have the two windows side by side. This may be difficult on a smaller screen, but is immensely helpful when developing a game with several Blueprints and references, as I expect to soon enough. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide33.PNG "Side by Side Panels")

Navigate back to the left pane, scroll to Volumes, and choose ‘Trigger Volume’ from the list. Drag this trigger volume box onto the scene. Then right click in the Blueprints window and choose Add Event for Trigger Volume 1 > Collision > Add on Actor Begin Overlap ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide34.PNG "Collision Event")

Notice that a new red node, titled OnActorBeginOverlap (TriggerVolume) has been created in the Blueprint window. This node is an event node; it also has pins which can be connected to the blue lightbulb node (the object node) to establish a relationship. Note also that the pins are colour-coded, which will be useful. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide35.PNG "Red Nodes")

Click on the blue pin of the Point Light and drag out a connector line. From the dialog box that pops up, type ‘visibility’ into the search bar, then click on Toggle Visibility. Two new nodes are created with connector links between them automatically set up. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide36.PNG "Connected Light to Event")

I have enlarged the Blueprint window here for easier reference and neatened the layout. Notice that the pins are colour and shape-coded, which makes for easy referencing between how each node’s pins connect to the others. In this case, the red event node, titled (OnActoBeginOverlap) has a white triangular pin, as does the blue function node, titled Toggle Visibility. Drag a connector (execute command) from the red node to the blue node. A relationship has now been created. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide37.PNG "Complete Blueprint of Trigger and Actor Overlap")

Navigate to the main scene window and press the Play button, located at the top of the window. Using the mouse and direction keys on the keyboard, move around the scene. Notice that when the player enters the light area, the light turns on. When the player exits and re-enters the light area, the light turns off. This is the toggle action that has been setup in Blueprints so far. To exit from the live scene and back into editing mode, hit Esc. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide38.PNG "Final Scene Created")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 3</h2>

Sliding Doors: In this example I am recreating a scene from scratch, which I learned from YouTube (Virtus Learning Hub). When the player approaches a door, the two glass panes slide away from each other, a light turns on and a sound plays. To create a sliding door, the object of the door has to first be created. In a new project, click on the arrow next to Content, then choose Props > Glass Window. Click and drag the glass window onto the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide39.PNG "Starter Content Assets")

The glass door has been created and is in the scene. The Contents folder has a sub-folder inside titled StarterContent. This is a useful repository of basic items that are found most often in games, and can be used to quickly mock up or prototype a game in Unreal Engine. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide40.PNG "Glass Door")

With the glass window selected, copy-paste the object  (Ctrl + C, then Ctrl + V) to create two glass windows. Together these will act as the glass doors that will slide open and close when an event is triggered. Before that, though, a pivot point needs to be set for the right door, from where the sliding action takes place. Otherwise both doors will slide open in the same direction instead of away from each other. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide41.PNG "Scene Created")

Right click the door, then choose Transform > Mirror Y (to flip it along the Y-axis). The right glass window / door flips over and the two pivot points (one for each door) are now at the far edges and in position. Remember to drag the right door away from the left, since mirroring along the Y-axis will create a perfect overlap with the other door. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide42.PNG "Mirroring")

Both the doors are now in position and ready for further actions. With the basic setup done, additional elements like lighting and door frames can be added from the Content > StarterContent folders. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide43.PNG "Setting Pivot Point")

In this example, I have created a door frame and added a point light. The point light and the sliding doors will be animated using Blueprints. The door frame adds a level of reference and perception to this example. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide44.PNG "Door Frame and Point Light")

The lightbulb intensity has been set to zero, and the colour has been changed to red. These settings can be accessed in the panel on the right, which activates when the object, in this case the lightbulb, has been clicked on. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide45.PNG "Light Intensity")

I am also adding a sound that will be played when the doors open. To access the sounds library, navigate to StarterContent > Audio, then drag an audio file onto the scene. In this example I am going to add the default Starter Music Cue. In the audio panel (which pops up when the audio element is selected) scroll to the Activation section and ensure that Auto Activate is deselected, so that the sound does not start playing as soon as the scene begins, but only when the door opens. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide46.PNG "Sound Asset")

This is the scene all ready and set for Blueprint controls. Add anything else that may make the scene more game-like. For this example, I am going to stick to the sliding doors, lightbulb and audio, as per the tutorial. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide47.PNG "Scene Setup")

Select one of the doors, then go to Cinematics > Add Matinee (Legacy) for the sake of the tutorial. A layers and play-head screen will open. This is where groups can be created, which will then be acted on together in Blueprints. Right click in the darker grey space to the left and select Add Empty Group. Give it an identifying label such as LeftDoor then press enter. Make sure that the door has been selected in the scene before creating the new empty group. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide48.PNG "Setting up Matinee")

Once the layer has been created, a bar will appear across the play area with the name given in the previous step. Right click on the layer and choose Add New Movement Track. Then drag the time bars out or in (at either ends of the frames play area) using the red triangle at the bottom of the extreme right-side bar (hold Alt and move the mouse to zoom out so that the entire timeline fits in the window), to set a duration for the door to move. In this example I have set it to 2 seconds. Once done, press enter to create a new keyframe. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide49.PNG "Amending Time Layers")

The duration of the door’s movement has been set to 2 seconds (from the previous step) and is shown by the green shaded area in the frames play area, bound by the two white lines. Pressing enter, once the duration has been set will create a keyframe at the beginning of the play-head. This keyframe looks like a red triangle. Hold down Ctrl and drag this red triangle out to where the end time bar has been set (in this case 2 seconds). Once done, navigate to the scene, and drag the door using the move command (W) to its open position. Press the Play button at the top of the Matinee window to watch the animation. The door slides open. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide50.PNG "Keyframes for Left Door")

Repeat the process for the RightDoor then press Play in the Matinee window. Now both doors slide away from each other. This is the basic setup for moving the doors. Other properties, such as intensity, transparency, rotation, colour, volume etc. can also be set using keyframes, as demonstrated in the next step, using lighting and sound. This interface is very familiar to users of Adobe AfterEffects or ScreenFlow. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide51.PNG "Keyframes for Right Door")

In this example, I have created a New Lighting Group (instead of new empty group) then made two keyframes for the lighting, one for the off state (at the beginning) and one for the on state (at the end). I have set the intensity to 5000 at the end, so that when the doors open, the light is on and bright. The intensity settings (as well as all the other light properties) can be adjusted from the scene window, on the right pane. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide52.PNG "Lighting Empty Group")

The final step is to add sound. Create a New Empty Group and give it the name SoundDoors, then right click and instead of choosing the usual movement track, choose Add New Sound Track. A new sound layer is created below the Sound Empty Group. Once again, ensure that the object is selected in the scene before creating these layers, otherwise it will not work. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide53.PNG "Sound Empty Group")

With the sound layers created, click on the white start time bar, and hit enter to create a new keyframe. The name of the audio file, in this case, Starter_Music_Cue, appears on the green bar. Press Play at the top of the Matinee Window and watch the scene. The doors slide open, the light comes on, and the sound plays. The next step is to setup Blueprints with delays. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide54.PNG "Keyframing Sound Group")

To trigger the matinee event, use a box trigger. Navigate to the left pane and select Basic > Box Trigger. Then drag the box trigger over to the scene and place it in front of the door. This will be the trigger for a player to activate, which will cause the matinee to play. Scale up the trigger area if needed so that the interaction area is large enough to catch any event. Instead of a box trigger, a trigger volume (from the previous notes) can also be used. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide55.PNG "Box Trigger Added")

A trigger volume node has been created in the Blueprints window. This trigger event can now be linked to the Matinee event. The trigger volume node is an event node (red) that needs to be connected to a function node (blue) via the corresponding pins, in this case white to white. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide56.PNG "Trigger Volume Node Added to Blueprints")

Make sure that in the scene panel the Matinee icon (a film clapper) is selected. Once done, return to the Blueprints window, right click then type Play in the search bar. Choose the Play function, which will create a Play node in the Blueprints window. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide57.PNG "Matinee Node Added to Blueprints")

The Play function for the Matinee has been created. To link the player movements to the matinee playback, simply link up the white pin on the Trigger Volume event node (in red) to the white pin on the Play function node (in blue). Once done, return to the scene window and click Play. When the player (camera first person) passes through the trigger area, the matinee plays – the doors slide open, the light shines and the sound turns on. However, the doors do not close after the event. To fix this, a delay needs to be added. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide58.PNG "Play Function Added to Matinee")

Right click in the Blueprints window, then type Delay. A Delay function is created. Link the Delay node to the Play node using the corresponding white pins. A Delay function can also take a duration value, i.e. the duration of the delay, or how long the action is held for before playing in reverse. This Delay function will then be connected to a Reverse function for the Matinee. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide59.PNG "Delay Function")

Ensure that the Matinee icon (film clapper) is selected in the scene. In the Blueprints window, right click and type ‘Reverse’ in the search bar. Ensure that the Reverse function under the Cinematic tab is selected. Link white pin in the Delay function node to the white pin in the Reverse node. Click on the Compile button at the top left of the main Blueprints window. The Blueprint is now complete. Return to the scene and press Play. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide60.PNG "Reverse Function")

This is the final scene, built entirely from Blueprints and the Matinee. In newer versions of Unreal Engine, the Matinee has been relegated to legacy mode, and replaced by Cinematics. However, the Matinee still works and can be used with Blueprints as shown in this example. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide61.PNG "Final Result")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 4</h2>

In this example, I have created the fire effect by going to StarterContent > Blueprints > Blueprints_Effect_Fire and dragged the instance of this fire onto the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide62.PNG "Fire Creation")

Double-click the Blueprints_Effects_Fire icon to enter the Blueprints for the fire effect. Then click on Viewport to enter the component mode of the fire effect. In this section I will change the effect of the fire’s interaction with the player. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide63.PNG "Component Manipulation")

Navigate to the Add Component button on the left pane, and add a Post Process component. Under the Colour Grading > White Balance > Global > Saturation settings, change the colour of the fire to the necessary tones required for the game, in this case red fire for water suppressant, blue fire for powder suppressant, and green fire for carbon dioxide suppressant. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide64.PNG "Fire Colour Settings")

Here I have created the red fire necessary for items which will require a water suppressant to put out the flames. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide65.PNG "Red Fire Instance")

Here I have created the blue fire necessary for items which will require a powder suppressant to put out the flames. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide66.PNG "Blue Fire Instance")

Here I have created the green fire necessary for items which will require a carbon dioxide suppressant to put out the flames. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide67.PNG "Green Fire Instance")

When the character gets hit by the flaming object the character takes on damage. This procedure has been built and integrated into the Blueprints of our game build. Note the use of Cast ToFirstPersonCharacter node and Apply Damage node function. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide68.PNG "Damage Application for Character")

Because this is a fire fighter game, and the main projectile source is a hose, the fire rate has to be constant when the mouse button (or appropriate trigger) is pressed and held, unlike a shotgun which works as a single press, single projectile release. I have used Blueprints here to reconfigure the fire rate of the first-person character in our game. The nodes in use are InputAction Fire; Sequence; Gate; Sequence; Montage Play; Retriggerable Delay. I then lowered the value of the duration in the Retriggerable Delay node to make the projectiles go faster, or stream, as is the case in hoses. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide69.PNG "Fire Rate")

The effect is clear to see and the spray of pellets works well. In the next steps following this Blueprint, I will convert the pellets to a more watery, and gassy substance to give the suppressant materials a more realistic look and feel. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide70.PNG "Fire Rate Demo")

In this example, I am using Blueprints to increase the explosive quality of the projectile on impact, as is the case when using a powder suppressant, where the material spreads and disseminates on impact with the object. I am altering the MyProjectile Blueprints, and have added a Radial Force, then increased the Impulse Strength in the right pane. I have also increased the destructible damage to little over 1, and the Radius Force to little over 230. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide71.PNG "Projectile Explosion")

Back in the event graph, remove the node for DestroyActor, and create a new Sphere > Get. Then link the Sphere node to a new function node, titled DestroyComponent. This is to prepare for the next step where the objects get destroyed but the particle and sound assets remain in place for a while longer. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide72.PNG "Object Destruction")

Create a new Radial Force > Get node, then drag out a connection from its pin and create a Fire Impulse function node. The Fire Impulse node will ensure that the destruction effects linger after the object has been destroyed. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide73.PNG "Fire Impulse Lingers")

However, the Fire Impulse node will keep playing the destruction effects back, and so I have created a Do Once node to make sure the Fire Impulse only occurs once per instance of destruction. Link the DestroyComponent function node to the DoOnce node, then link the Completed pin on the DoOnce node to the FireImpulse node to force the FireImpulse function to perform just one instance of destruction. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide74.PNG "Single Instance of Destruction")

Once that relationship has been setup, drag out a connector from the pin of the FireImpulse function node and create a new function called Spawn Emitter at Location. From the Emitter Template choose the desired effect. I have chosen the Explosion effect template for testing, but will ultimately choose the steam effect, which is what happens when an object on fire is doused. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide75.PNG "Spawn Emitter Location")

Because the location of the emitter matters, re-drag a connector from the radial force pin and create a GetWorldLocation node. Then link the Return pin on the GetWorldLocation node to the Location pin on the Spawn Emitter at Location node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide76.PNG "World Location")

From the white pin on the Spawn Emitter at Location, drag out a new connector and create the Spawn Sound Attached node. Then choose Explosion01 from the Sound Template dropdown menu within the SpawnSoundAttached node. Then connect the Return Value pin on the SpawnEmitteratLocation node to the Attach to Component pin on the SpawnSoundAttached node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide77.PNG "Sound Emitter")

Finally, drag out a connector form the SpawnSoundAttached node and create a delay node and set the duration to 2. Then drag out the a connector from the Completed pin on the Delay node to create the DestroyActor node. Compile the Blueprint and play the game in the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide78.PNG "Actor Destruction")

I have altered the sound effects to a hissing steam sound, rather than an explosion, and changed the visual output to vapour rising, which fits perfectly with the theme of the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide79.PNG "Sound Effect Altered")

This Blueprint record shows the changes, with respect to the output above, as well as the entire flow of logic for this process. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide80.PNG "Final Blueprint for Game Douse Effects")


<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 5</h2>

Day and Night Cycles in Unreal Engine 4 With Blueprints: In this example I will be learning how to use Blueprints to change the default noon-day static lighting to a continuously looping day-night cycle, complete with sunrises, sunsets, and dark starry skies. In the World Outliner pane (on the right) type in Light Source Directional to locate the asset. Then scroll down to the properties panel > Transform > Mobility, and change the mobility to moveable. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide81.PNG "Day Night Cycle Started")

Once the light source has been set to moveable, open the Level Blueprints, then right-click and type timeline. Click on the Add Timeline to create a Timeline_0 node. This is the node that will rove the light across the sky over the timeline, creating the day and night cycle. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide82.PNG "Day Moveable Light Source")

The timeline node has been added to the Blueprint. Double-click on the node to access the timeline template properties. Modifications are required in this section to control to the duration and loop of the timeline. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide83.PNG "Timeline Node Added")

In the timeline template view (after double-clicking the node) change the Length value from 5 seconds (default) to 24 seconds. Therefore each second will represent an hour in the game. Then check the boxes for AutoPlay and Loop. This is to ensure the day and night cycle are automatic and keep looping forever. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide84.PNG "Duration and Loops")

Once the parameters for the Length, AutoPlay, and Loop are set, click on the F (function) button to create a float track. In the name box, enter a name for the float track. This float track will control the position of the moveable light source. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide85.PNG "Float Track Added")

Create a new keyframe by clicking and pressing shift together. In the Time box, enter 0, and in the Value box, enter 0. These settings signify the start of the day. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide86.PNG "Sunrise Values")

Create another keyframe (click + shift) and in the Time box enter 24, and in the Value box, enter 360. These settings for this keyframe signify the end of the day-night cycle. Note that the value box contains the angle of sweep for the light source as it curves around and under the scene, like the sun and the earth. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide87.PNG "Sunset Values")

Press the ‘Horizontal Zoom’ and ‘Vertical Zoom’ buttons at the top left of the graph shows the linear relationship that has been created. Once this is done, return to Blueprints by closing the timeline template box tab. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide88.PNG "Linear Relationship Graph")

Keeping both windows open (Level Blueprints and Scene Editor) drag in the Light Source asset into the Blueprints window to create the Light Source node. Note that at this stage the motion of the light source (as per the timeline template) is linear. To make the light source rotate around the scene, a rotation node is required. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide89.PNG "Light Source Node")

Right-click in the Blueprints window and type ‘Make Rotator’ to create the corresponding node. Then link the Y Pitch pin in the ‘Make Rotator’ node to the Position pin in the ‘Timeline_0’ node. This will cause the linear relationship to take on degree rotation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide90.PNG "Rotator Node")

Drag a connector from the blue pin on the Light Source node, and create a ‘SetActorRotation’ function node. This function node will control the rotation. From the ‘Make Rotator’ node, drag a connector from the Return Value pin and connect it to the New Rotation pin on the ‘SetActorRotation’ node. Next, drag a connector from the Update pin in the ‘Timeline_0’ node and connect it to the white pin of the ‘SetActorRotation’ node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide91.PNG "Set Actor Rotation Function Node")

Navigate back to the scene window, and from the World Outliner, type in skysphere. Then drag the asset into the Blueprints window to create the SkySphereBlueprint node. This node represents the sun point-light in the sky, for the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide92.PNG "Sky Sphere Node")

From the ‘SkySphereBlueprint’ node, drag a connector off the blue pin and type ‘Update Sun Direction’ to create the corresponding node. This node controls the direction of the sun’s light as it moves over the scene. Drag a connector from the white pin of the ‘Set Actor Rotation’ node and link it to the white pin on the ‘Update Sun Direction’ node. Now the rotation and the sunlight direction are linked, so when the sun rotates the light direction changes accordingly. The Blueprint is ready. Click on Compile, then return to the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide93.PNG "Light Direction")

In the scene editor window, click on Build > Build Lighting Only to rebuild the lighting and link up the new assets within this scene. The lighting has to re-built to reflect the most up-to-date settings for the lighting assets (worked on in Blueprints) otherwise the scene will default to the current lighting state and the changes will not be played out in the scene during simulation. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide94.PNG "Rebuilding Lighting")

A message at the bottom right of the screen will provide information on far along the build for the lighting has progressed. Once the build is complete, press the play button from the icon menu above to simulate the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide95.PNG "Lighting Re-Built")

The sun is now moving across the sky at one second per hour representation. Notice also that the colours of the sky change as the sun dips and rises and the shadows grow long and short accordingly. This is because the light direction was set accordingly in the Blueprints. These values can be changed in the timeline editor. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide96.PNG "Scene Testing")

This is the completed Blueprint for the day-night cycle, complete with the nodes, connections, and flow of logic that is being used in the scene. This Blueprint will be used in the group’s Fire Fighter game to provide a more realistic environment with the addition of a day-night cycle. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide97.PNG "Completed Blueprint")


<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 6</h2>

Blueprints for Player AI Explosion on Collision: In this example I am learning to create a Blueprint scenario in which an AI collides with a player, catches on fire, and damages the health of the player. Begin by duplicating the character in the scene. Go to the Blueprints folder > ThirdPersonCharacter, then right-click and select Duplicate. Rename the new asset that has been created to a meaningful name. I have labelled this asset TP_Duplicate. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide98.PNG "Setup Blueprint")

Double-click the TP_Duplicate asset to enter its Blueprints class. Delete the entire set of nodes and logic flows as these will all be re-built from scratch. Once that’s done, navigate to the Add Component button at the top left of the window, in the Components pane. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide99.PNG "Duplicate Character for Testing")

In the search bar, type in Pawn Sensing. The Pawn Sensing function allows the AI to interact or sense the main character in the game, and then perform various tasks including following the main character and exploding or catching on fire. Once that is done, click compile. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide100.PNG "pawn Sensing")

Select the Pawn Sensing component from the pane on the left, then right-click in the Blueprints window and create a node titled Add On See Pawn. A red event node is created. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide101.PNG "On See Pawn")

Drag out a connector from the white pin of the On See Pawn node, then type Cast To Third Person Character to create the corresponding node. This will allow the event to see the character and then perform a scripted action. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide102.PNG "Cast to Character")

Drag out a new connector from the Cast To Third Person Character node and create an AI Move To node. This node tells the AI where to move when the game is run. Then, connect the blue pin (As Third Person Character) from the Cast To Third Person Character node to the blue pin of the AI Move To node (Target Actor). Next, drag out a connector from the blue pin (pawn) of the Ai Move To node, then type in Self to create a Self node, which will link the AI’s movements back to itself. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide103.PNG "Cast to Character")

From the Object pin on the Cast To Character node, drag out a connector, then type Get Player Character to create a new function node titled Get Player Character. At this stage, if compile is clicked, the duplicate AI (which requires dragging onto the scene from the icon tray) is created and will follow the main character around the scene without colliding or causing any interaction. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide104.PNG "Cast to Character")

From the white pin titled On Success, in the AI Move To node, drag out a connector and type DestroyActor to create the corresponding function node. This relationship is to destroy the AI itself upon successful collision with the main character. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide105.PNG "AI Destruction")

From the white pin on the Destroy Actor node, drag out a connector and create a Spawn Emitter at Location node. Under the Emitter Template dropdown, choose P_Fire. This makes the AI catch fire when it collides with the main character. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide106.PNG "Spawn Fire")

In order to make the AI’s fire occur where the main character or player is, a new node is required. Drag out a connector from the yellow Location pin on the Spawn Emitter at Location node, and create a new node titled GetActorLocation. This function node controls where the fire will occur when the AI collides, i.e. wherever the player’s location is. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide107.PNG "Fire Emission Location")

In order for the main character to lose health on impact with the AI, a health variable needs to be created. Open up the Blueprints for the main character, i.e. ThirdPersonCharacter by double-clicking, then create a new variable. Rename this variable to something meaningful. I titled the variable MyHealth. Then navigate to the Details pane on the right, and from the Variable Type dropdown box, choose Integer. This is a number that can be incremented or decremented. Once this is done, save this ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint, and return to the AI, i.e. TP_Duplicate Blueprint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide108.PNG "Player Health Variable")

In the TP_Duplicate Blueprint, navigate back to the Cast To Third Person Character node, then drag a connector from the pin titled As Third Person Character and create a new node by typing in the name of variable, i.e. MyHealth. This is why it is important to use meaningful names that are easy to recall because these assets are stored within Blueprints for later references. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide109.PNG "Linked Health Vairable to AI Impact")

From the SET node containing the player health variable, connect the white pin to the corresponding white pin on the Spawn Emitter at Location node. Then drag out a connector from the MyHealth pin on the SET node and create a -integer node. This will decrease the player’s health upon collision with the AI. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide110.PNG "Decrease Health Integer")

Once again, navigate back to the Cast To Third Person Character node, then drag yet another new connector from the pin titled As Third Person Character and create a new node by typing in get My Health. This will create a new node that targets the current health of the player. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide111.PNG "Calculate Current Health and Decrement on AI Impact")

Connect the pin titled My Health on this new node to the top pin of the -integer node. In the bottom pin of the -integer node, type in 34 in the numbers value box. Note that this box is a percentage, so that every hit takes away a percentage of the player’s life. By setting it to 34, the player has three chances before all life is gone (i.e. when the total hits exceed 100%). When this is done, click compile. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide112.PNG "Three Lives Given to Player")

If for any reason the AI does not follow the main player, navigate to the left pane, click on Volumes > Nav Mesh Bounds Volume and drag this bounding box onto the scene. Scale up the box to as big as possible to cover the entire play area. I used 30 for the X, Y, and Z values. Once done, click play and begin running immediately. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide113.PNG "Volume Bound Mesh")

The AI now collides with the main player and sets the player on fire. Now that I have learned how to make objects move towards the main character and cause the main character to catch on fire and lose health, I will be integrating this Blueprint into our project as the logic for which the fire fighter will lose health if the fire coming towards the player is not put out in time or by using an adequate fire suppressant. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide114.PNG "Testing Blueprints")

This is the complete Blueprint for the AI script and behaviour governing its logic. The final step is to destroy the main character when health levels fall below zero. This is done in the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint, and not in the AI TP_Duplicate Blueprint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide115.PNG "Final Blueprints")

In the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint, create a new event node called Event Tick. This node measures a value at each second of the game, in this case the player’s health. Create another node called Branch. The Branch node provides a Boolean measure (true or false). Drag out a connector from the Condition pin on the Branch node and type Integer < Integer to create the corresponding node. This node sets up a condition such that if the player’s health is less than 1 or 0, the Branch will perform a function. Drag out a connector from the True pin on the Branch node (since True means the condition satisfies the requirements) and create a new node function called DestroyActor. This logic is now complete. If the player’s health is less than 1 or 0, the player is destroyed. The Blueprint uses the Event Tick node to constantly measure if the player’s health is greater than 1 and if not, will pass off the function of killing the player via the Branch and DestroyActor nodes.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide116.PNG "Measuring Current Player Health")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 7</h2>

In several instances, a GitHub credential error might occur, which prevents pushing the changes made to the Blueprints out into the GitHub repo. This error is commonly associated with repos that have Git LFS (Git Large File Storage) installed. In this case, the error says 'Exit Status 1'. The image of the error screen is as follows: ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/Unreal-Engine-Fire-Fighter-Game-Repo/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/GitHub-Credential-Error.PNG "GitHub Credential Error")

If an error such as the one documented above is encountered, proceed to do the following: Make sure Git is installed on the computer encountering the error. Open GitHub Desktop > Repository > Open in Command Prompt. In the Command Prompt type the following line of code: <pre><code>del /f .git\hooks\pre-push</code></pre> and ensure that all spaces are followed exactly as typed in the code. Hit 'Enter' or 'Return' then push the commits again. (This fix is for Windows but also works on Mac. For Mac computers, follow the exact procedure described, but use the Terminal app instead of the Command Prompt).

The FBX asset for the barbecue stove has been completed and imported into the Blueprints folder. The asset interacts with the player as a game object and can now be manipulated through Unreal Engine's Blueprint programme options. In this example I have overlaid the barbecue stove asset with an object on fire to preview the effect as it would appear during gameplay. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide117.PNG "BBQ Stove FBX")

The barbecue stove has been re-shaded using native Unreal Engine shaders to integrate the asset into the scene. A darker hue was applied to give it a pre-burnt effect, which aids player recognition and learning when encountering the object. This barbecue stove requires an H2O suppressant and will be lit up using the red colour fire. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide118.PNG "BBQ Stove Re-Shaded")

The FBX asset for the chair has been completed and imported into the Blueprints folder. Like the BBQ stove, the chair was imported as an FBX asset and is now a game object that can be interacted with the player. The chair has a few additional shaders added to its different components. Using Blueprints and the in-built materials of Unreal Engine, I was able to give the chair a wooden texture, which works appropriately since this is a fire hazard that requires the H2O suppressant. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide119.PNG "Chair FBX")

With the base material applied using Blueprints, I navigated to the Materials folder (by clicking on the preset material and choosing New Material Instance. I then took an existing wooden material and re-applied it to the chair to create the wooden frame and body. I also saved this material as a unique instance for the chair. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide120.PNG "Chair Material")

The final step was to integrate the chair into the scene and scale its size to fit with the rest of the game objects. As this chair will be a haunted item (i.e. will have its own laws of physics) it is important that the chair look and feel as natural as possible so that when the non-physical behaviour commences, the player's experience of the haunted fire tunnel will possibly be enhanced. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide121.PNG "Chair Integration")

In creating the smokey hissing sound for when an object's fire is extinguished, we created a Blueprint logic that blasts the sound initially, but then fades the sound out to create a more realistic suppressant effect. We were able to achieve this logic for all objects by applying a FadeOut function to the pre-built sounds offered within Unreal Engine. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide122.PNG "Smoke Fade Out Sound")


<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 8</h2>

To create a new level in Unreal Engine 4, click on File > New Level, then choose the default option. Unreal Engine 4 will create an empty scene. In this mode the entire scene and all its elements can be built from scratch using the tools and options provided in Unreal Engine. The basic setup even allows for no floor at all, a useful feature for games that require scaling or flight management scenarios. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide123.PNG "Tunnel Terrain")

Click on the Landscape icon (the image of a mountain) from the Modes panel on the top left to bring up the landscape editor. This editor enables resizing of the landscape along the X (length), Y (width), and Z (thickness) axes. It is very important to note that the Z location and the Z Scale must be the same so that the player is either on the terrain or above it, but never below it, otherwise the player will either fall through the ground, or remain stuck and unable to move before gameplay commences. In this example, I will be leaving the scale as 100 by 100. The Section Size (measured in Quads) is the number of checked squares. The more squares the higher the resolution. I will be setting this Section Size to 63 by 63 quads. Finally, I will be setting a material for the scene, in this case old brick. Once all the settings have been entered, click ‘Create’. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide124.PNG "Landscape Edits")

The flooring of the tunnel has been created in the old, underground brick style. Currently, the scene is open on all sides but this will be addressed at a later stage by adding walls and a ceiling around the playable area. While the material is adequate, the flooring looks far too new by virtue of its evenness. This can be fixed by using the Sculpt tool to add a variety of topographies and features to the terrain. Navigate to the Sculpt tool and explore the options presented. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide125.PNG "Brick Materials")

In this example I have used the hydro-erosion, erosion, smooth, and noise options to create an older-looking, uneven terrain. By adjusting the settings under each option (using the sliders and values in the Tool Settings panel) the terrain can be manipulated into the desired effect. Similar effects can also be applied to the walls and ceiling of the scene to create a systematically random worn-out look. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide126.PNG "Unevenness")

I have added a ramp to this scene to test the viability of creating deliberately uneven surfaces made by humans, juxtaposed with unevenness caused by natural wear and tear. Unreal Engine 4 provides ample options to create a variety of terrains and effects using the in-built tools. Combined with lighting and atmospheric fog, the appropriate scene of a haunted tunnel will be modelled and constructed almost entirely within Unreal Engine. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide127.PNG "Ramp")

In this example I am using the ramp to test the effects of the vanishing point by creating a narrowing perspective. The terrain is already starting to resemble a worn out tunnel. Further refinements will be carried out as the level is constructed, but this Blueprint will help the group to rapidly prototype and test playability within the environment of the game. A useful tip to begin gameplay at the point of edit, is to right-click and choose the ‘Play From Here’ option. This option begins gameplay at the point of view during edit, rather than at the fixed spawn point of the scene, which occurs when the Play button (top menu) is pressed. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide128.PNG "Playing From Immediate Area")

This is the first render of the tunnel environment scene, currently under testing for materials adequacy and basic geometry / topography. As the group imports more assets into the scene, the lighting and atmosphere will consequently be adjusted to drive the visuals towards our ultimate haunted tunnel environment. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide129.PNG "Initial GamePlay Environment Testing")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 9</h2>

Creating the Fire Cave: In this stage, I will be creating the environment from scratch for the Fire Fighter game that I am building and prototyping. I will start by creating the landscape and then proceed to build the character attributes and play assets. Start by creating an empty project, then scale the landscape along the x and y axes to increase the play area. Because this is going to be the entrance to a cave, I have lengthened the x axis to 8.0 and the y axis to 2.0. I have left the z axis as-is as the thickness of the landscape will be immaterial to the gameplay. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide130.PNG "Final Landscape Build Commenced")

To optimise the development, I have disabled Realtime by clicking on the dropdown arrow at the top left and deselecting the checkbox that says Realtime. This will increase the viewport render and take up fewer computing resources since building in Unreal Engine can be CPU-intensive.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide131.PNG "Disabled Realtime")

I have added a box asset to the scene to get a sense of the scale of the environment since the player needs to be proportionate to the environment in which it is operating. I dragged the box in from the Geometry panel and resized it using the scale tool to 0.1 along the x axis, 0.1 along the y axis and 0.4 along the z axis. The box now represents the width and height of the player. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide132.PNG "Box Asset Added")

Add the Unreal Engine 4 mannequin to the scene. If the mannequin is not in the content folder as an asset, download the mannequin for free from Unreal Engine 4’s marketplace, then follow the prompts to add the mannequin asset to the project, in this case my cave scene. Unreal Engine 4 will create a new folder in the Content Folder, with the title, UE4_Mannequin_Mobile. Double click to open this folder, then navigate to the Mesh folder and double-click that folder. Left-click and drag the mannequin onto the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide133.PNG "UE Mannequin Added")

Here I have rotated and resized the mannequin to match the proportions of the scene, using the initial block I created as a yardstick. With the mannequin in the scene and at the correct proportions, I can now start building out the landscape of the cave. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide134.PNG "Positioned UE Mannequin")

To add to the feeling of the scene, I have changed the sunlight colour to a more reddish-purple glow that is symptomatic of a distant fire. I have also played with the shadows to make them darker and more intense, which will add to the feeling of the game’s intensity. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide135.PNG "Sun Colour to Pink-Purple")

Add atmospheric fog to the scene by dragging the Atmospheric Fog asset from the Visual Effects panel onto the scene. Use the move tool to position the cloud icon (representing the atmospheric fog). Ensure that while the sunlight asset is selected, within the Light dropdown section (advanced options) the Atmospheric Sun Light checkbox is selected. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide136.PNG "Atmospheric Fog")

Use the Box asset to add two side walls and a far wall to block off three of the four openings to the scene. The area behind the character is the entrance to the landscape area and will therefore remain open. It is simpler to create one long wall, scale and position it perfectly, then duplicate it (Ctrl + W) and position it along the other edge of the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide137.PNG "Walls")

Add a player start point to the scene by clicking on the Basic panel and choosing the Player Start asset. Drag the asset to the scene and position it over the player. The player start asset will inform of whether the mannequin size and the player start mesh size are commensurate with each other. If they are not the player start asset will display a sign saying ‘Bad Size’. Resize the player start asset using the scale tool to make the mesh the same size as that of the mannequin. Once the sizes are in proportion, the ‘Bad Size’ sign will disappear. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide138.PNG "Start Asset")

To ensure that the light distribution is even across the scene, drag out a lightmass importance volume asset from the Volumes pane, and resize the lightmass importance volume box to cover the play area.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide139.PNG "Lightmass Importance Volume")

Using the materials palette in the StarterContent folder, give the walls and the flooring a watery material to provide a dynamic and hypnotic effect. The continuous motion provides an interesting visual and complements the element of water as the mainstay of the game’s strategy to put out the fires. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide140.PNG "Watery Material")

I have added a ceiling to the landscape and given all the walls a fluid, watery material that keeps moving randomly. The environment in its basic form is beginning to take shape. With the ceiling in place, the corridor has a spooky but futuristic appearance that invites a degree of exploration, which is the purpose of the game. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide141.PNG "Scene Ceiling")

To give the scene a more futuristic lighting effect I am creating a Tron-like glow material from scratch within Blueprints. This glow should provide the landscape not only with some visual interest but also add to the playability of the scene by providing implicit direction of where the player needs to focus attention. Start by creating a new material, giving it a name (I called mine Tron_Glow) then double-click the material icon to access its Blueprint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide142.PNG "Tron-Like Effect")

To get the Tron-like effect, first create a Text Coordinate node. Then drag out a Mask node from the white pin of the Text Coordinate node and create a Mask node. In the Material Expression Component Mask pane (bottom left) click only G for the green channel. Duplicate this Mask node, drag out and connect another link from the Text Coordinate white pin, and this time click only R for the red channel. Drag out connectors from both masks and add Multiply nodes. In the expression box, change the multiply value from 1.0 to 0.5. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide143.PNG "Text Coordinates and Masks")

Add two Sine nodes, one for each Mask and connect them up with their respective white pins. The add a one-minus node, duplicate it, and again link up the one-minus nodes to the Sine nodes via the white pins. The effect of the black and white gradient lines are now more prominent. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide144.PNG "Sine and One-Minus Nodes")

Add two more Power (exponent) nodes and connect one to each of the one-minus nodes via the respective white pins. Then create a Scalar Component, give it a name (since it will be labelled as None by default). I called mine Scalar-Properties. In the Default Value input box for the Scalar-Properties node, type 30. Link up the Exp pins on both the Power nodes to the white pin on the Scalar Properties node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide145.PNG "Power and Scalar Component One")

Add two more Subtract nodes and another Scalar Component node. For the Subtract nodes, put in 0.1 for the value. Next, create a new Scalar Property node, and give it any name. I gave mine Scalar-Properties-Two. Then link the A pins on the Subtract nodes to each of the power nodes, and link the B pins on the Subtract nodes to the single white pin on the new Scalar-Properties-Two node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide146.PNG "Subtract and Scalar Component Two")

Add a linear interpolate node (defaults to a Lerp node). Then drag out a connector and create a Multiply node. Create another Multiply node and connect the two Multiply nodes together. Create a Vector Parameter node and rename it Colour. Choose a colour from the default value box. I chose a matching pinkish-purple. Create another Scalar Component node which will control the glow strength and name it. I called mine Scalar-Properties-Three. Connect the white pin on this node to the white pin on the newest Multiply node. Finally, connect the white pin from the newest Multiply node to the Emissive Colour pin on the Tron_Glow material node. The box in the left panel now has glowing pinkish-purple edges and is ready for use.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide147.PNG "Linear Interpolation and Third Scalar Node")

This is the result of the Tron Blueprint. The Scalar-Properties One, Two, and Three can be controlled using the sliders, which will affect the glow strength, intensity and size of the object to which it has been assigned. Even the colour can be changed.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide148.PNG "Final Result on Box I")

By playing with the values a variety of different effects can be achieved for the glow shape. Adjust each of the three sliders to achieve the desired effect. To get these corner-type effects, set the first Scalar Property to 5, the second to 1.3 and the third to 0.5. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide149.PNG "Final Result on Box II")

Here is the Tron glow effect added to the landscape walls. The glowing edges create a natural vanishing point towards the playable area, and add plenty of visual interest to the scene. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide150.PNG "Laser Outline Applied to Walls")

In this iteration, I have created a new material instance and applied it to the mannequin itself. The suit is now glowing and the outline looks much more dynamic and appealing than the default white material. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide151.PNG "Laser Outline Applied to Mannequin")

Here is the final iteration of the scene, ready for use in the final game play. The fiery red wall at the end of the vanishing point is the source of all the fire and will spawn all the objects that will come towards the player. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide152.PNG "Laser Outline Applied to Fire Spawn Area")

To keep the player within the bounds of the game, I have created a series of laser bars that prevent the player from exiting the playable area. The laser bars, like everything else in this landscape scene, are built entirely of the Tron custom material that I have created and that will power most of the environmental assets of this game. The material is built entirely of colour values and requires no textures. Therefore the load on the game is minimal while the effect is at full force. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide153.PNG "Final Environment Complete")

<h2>Unreal Engine and Blueprints: Section 10</h2>
In this Blueprint, I am creating a fire and water projectile system. The first step is to open the First Player HUD and correct the cross-hairs so that the projectiles are vectored in the precise direction of the shooter’s sights. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide154.PNG "Adding Water and Fire projectiles")

The cross-hairs have been correctly aligned along the X and Y axes for the shooter sights. Click ‘Compile’ and exit the First Person HUD blueprint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide155.PNG "Cross-Hairs")

Next, open the First Person Character blueprint to align the character itself along the target cross-hairs and also delete any spheres from the shooter. This is because the spheres (default) will be replaced by fire and water projectiles. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide156.PNG "First-Person Shooter View")

Focus on the Spawn Projectile section of the blueprint, then click on the ‘Sphere’ component listing on the left panel, and delete this sphere from the FP Gun. This will get rid of the default yellow balls that Unreal Engine employs. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide157.PNG "Removed Default Sphere")

Then, delete the ‘GetWorldLocation’ node since the location is no longer a factor without the spheres. These spheres will be replaced by the fire / water projectile streams. Click ‘Compile’ but do not exit the blueprint as yet; the fire and water projectiles will be added next. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide158.PNG "Get World Location")

Create a new ‘Left Mouse Button’ node in the space below the Spawn blueprint node set. Then drag out a connection from the ‘Pressed’ pin and create a new node called ‘Branch’. The ‘Branch’ node will control the condition during fire. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide159.PNG "Assigned Left Mouse Button")

Drag out a connection from the red connection pin of the ‘Branch’ node and click ‘Promote to Variable’ to make the node into a variable. The ‘Branch’ node will check whether the gun is shooting fire or water. In the Variable Name field (right panel) enter a name for the variable, in this case isFire. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide160.PNG "Branch Variables")

Create two more ‘Add Custom Event’ nodes, and give each one a name. The first one is called ‘ProjectFire’ and the second one is called ‘ProjectWater’. As might be expected, each custom event will be connected up to the relevant projectile, i.e. fire or water. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide161.PNG "Custom Events")

Create a new function and call it ‘LineTrace’. Drag out a connector and create a node called ‘Sequence’. Drag out a connector from the ‘Then 0’ pin on the ‘Sequence’ node and create a new node called ‘LineTraceByChannel’. Next, pull in the ‘First Person Camera’ node from the panel on the left. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide162.PNG "Camera Line Tracer")

Drag out a connector from the ‘First Person Camera’ node and create a new node called ‘GetWorldLocation’. This will establish the world location for the shooter and projectile. Connect the ‘Return Value’ pin from the ‘GetWorldLocation’ to the ‘Start’ pin on the ‘LiveTraceByChannel’ node. Next, drag out a new connector and create a new node called ‘GetForwardVector’. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide163.PNG "Forward Vector")

From the ‘GetWorldLocation’ node, drag out a connector from the ‘Return Value’ pin and create a ‘x float’ node. Change the value in the box to 5000. Then drag out a new connection from the ‘Return Value’ pin on the ‘GetWorldLocation’ node and create a ‘+vector+vector float’ node. Connect the ‘x float’ yellow pin to the ‘+vector+vector float’ node. The node will change type. Then connect the new node type’s yellow pin to the ‘End’ pin on the ‘LiveTraceByChannel’ node.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide164.PNG "Live Trace Channel")

Drag out a new node called ‘Break Hit Result’. This node controls the end of the action. Create one more ‘x float’ node and one more ‘+vector+vector’ node. Connect up the ‘Location Pin’ on the ‘Break Hit Result’ node to the ‘+vector+vector’ pin, then drag out a connection from the outgoing yellow pin to create a new ‘LineTraceChannel’ node. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide165.PNG "Updated Live Trace Channel")

Connect the ‘x float’ node to the ‘+vector+vector’ node. Finally, create a new ‘Branch’ node and connect the ‘False’ pin from this node to a new ‘LineTraceByChannel’ node. Then drag a connector from the white pin of the ‘Branch’ node to the ‘Then 0’ pin of the ‘Sequence’ node created earlier. Click compile and save. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide166.PNG "Line Trace Completed")

The next stage is to work on the first person weapon blueprint, found under ‘FP Weapon’ in the ‘First Person’ folder. Click on Skeleton from the top right, then right click on Grip Bone from the left panel options and create a new socket. Click on Muzzle and move the socket into position. This will be the spawn point for the projectile. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide167.PNG "Adjusted Muzzle Socket")

Return to the ‘First Person Character’ blueprint, then create the ‘FP Gun’ node. Connect the pins to the ‘LineTraceByChannel’ nodes and click ‘Compile’ then save the blueprint. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide168.PNG "Updated First Person Gun")

In the Event Graph set up the logic for the fire and water by using the functions created in the previous steps. Then create a ‘flipflop’ node and connect it to a new ‘keyboard X’ node. Hitting x will switch between the fire and water projectiles. Click compile and save. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide169.PNG "Flip Flop Functionality")

This is the shooter with a water projectile.  ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide170.PNG "Water Projectile")

This is the shooter with a fiery projectile. ![alt tag](https://github.com/arjunkhara/FireFighterGame/blob/master/blueprints/unreal-blueprints-images-folder/Slide171.PNG "Fiery Powder Projectile")

# Final Game Report (Arjun Khara)

<h4>Introduction</h4>
This report forms a formal part of, and frequently references, the documentation and learnings recorded in my GitHub repository. ‘Haunted Hose’ (developed under the pseudonym ‘FireFighter’) is a video game, built and programmed entirely by two team members, Arjun Khara and Daniel Nicholson, for the final winter term projects at Goldsmiths College, University of London, to fulfil the requirements for two modules: Introduction to Programming, and Introduction to Modelling and Animation. The project is categorised as a serious game owing to  its additional characterising goals, beyond pure entertainment, of fire-safety education and awareness, specifically on suppressant types — water, carbon dioxide, and powder — used to combat various fires. The game was built on Unreal Engine 4 using a combination of Blueprints and direct C++ programming. Models and assets for the game were created using Maya and Blender, which were then imported into Unreal Engine as FBX objects and reconstructed for game use. Development commenced in mid-October 2017, and concluded in mid-January 2018 as a minimum viable product (MVP) to meet the assessment requirements for both of the modules.

<h4>Conceptualisation</h4>
The idea of a fire-fighting game originated out of a shared interest between the two team members about the relative lack of interest in fire safety procedures and basic awareness of a threat that has constantly hung over and plagued societies across time and geographies. Rudimentary gap analysis, conducted by the team, revealed a clear disconnect between the seriousness of the issue, and the nonchalant attitudes towards the problem. Fire safety is typically relegated as the concern of occupational and site experts, and not in the domain of everyday life. This outlook is common across societies throughout the world, and formed a point of discussion between the members, one of whom is from Asia and the other from the United Kingdom. The team decided to tackle this issue by creating a game that would entertain and educate.

<h4>Gameplay</h4>
The essence of ‘Haunted Hose’ is to extinguish various fires by choosing an appropriate suppressant. The game begins in a futuristic haunted passageway with a Tron-like decor, in which ordinary household items are unexpectedly set ablaze and hurtle towards the player, who must quickly toggle between three suppressants to put out the conflagration. The player adopts a first-person point-of-view: holding a snazzy hose from the future, and looking down the passageway to an inferno at the end. From this inferno emerges flaming chairs, statues, tomb stones, electric cars, and barbecue stoves. The player is required to adapt quickly to the oncoming object, gauge the type of fire from the colour of the flame, and choose the correct suppressant for the hose. There are three types of fire: regular; electric; gas. Likewise, the hose contains a suppressant for each: water; carbon dioxide; powder. When the appropriate suppressant is used, the fire, and the object, are extinguished and the player carries on. Using an incorrect suppressant on a fire grows the conflagration and the approaching object collides with the player causing damage to the player’s health. Three burning hits results in the player’s health being fully depleted and gameplay ends. As an MVP the game delivers on this mechanic; in future versions, the game contains a quiz on fire safety issues, which a player may quickly answer correctly to gain an extra life. The game is therefore entertaining on its face, but embedded with mechanics that drive the player to make gameplay decisions that are reflected in real life. The underlying ring of accuracy contains the game’s ethos of amusement and eduction, which characterises it as a serious game.

<h4>Platform</h4>
Developed initially for the PC platform, the player’s controls were setup accordingly. The player is fixed in space, only able to swing left or right, and up or down. Forward and backward mobility has been restricted to reinforce the fixedness of the player’s position, and increase intensity of play. Controls from swinging left and right, and up and down, come from mouse movements. Toggling between suppressants requires clicking between the A, S, and D keys. The keys were chosen because: (a) these are most associated with control keys for PC games; (b) these are the initials of the names of each of the team members, when the team had three members (i.e. Arjun Khara; Sarah Chalk; Daniel Nicholson). The left mouse button expels the suppressant. The right mouse button toggles between the three suppressants as an alternative to the A, S, and D keys. Though useful as a quick selection option, the caveat is the player needs to remember the order of suppressants when cycling through each with the right mouse button, whereas the keyboard keys each have a dedicated suppressant assigned. The team focused on this additional mechanic to increase the pressure and challenge as gameplay intensifies and a player faces the added confusion of choice of controls, over and above the need to select the appropriate suppressant. The team wanted to drive the idea of actual panic through a fun and unforeseen dilemma.

<h4>Development</h4>
A combination of software tools were used to build and manage this project. The game itself was built using Unreal Engine 4 in a first-person mode. Blueprints were used to develop most of the logic for the game’s performance and play applications, with smaller degrees of pure C++ programming occasionally used. Modelling for assets was done in Maya and Blender, then imported as FBX assets into Unreal Engine 4 and reconstituted to work in the game. Shaders, materials and textures were used in Maya and Blender, to assess the overall look and feel. Additional texture qualities were added from Substance Painter. Development for the environment was built entirely in Unreal Engine 4, using material instances to save on resources and keep game speeds optimised. Beyond these core tools, the team utilised support software for project management and collaboration. GitHub was used for version control, to collaborate across all builds and changes, and for sharing and storing all assets. Documentation for this project was recorded on GitHub’s readme pages, along with all reference images of blueprint and modelling screenshots. In the beginning of the project, the team expected to use a waterfall approach to managing and building out this project, but as the team size felt to two members, a LEAN approach was adopted to keep the project on time and in control. Initial versioning and delegation of responsibilities were controlled through Trello, to establish a Kanban Board system. Tasks and duties were filtered through Trello before being accepted by each team member. YouTube was used to demonstrate a video of the game play-through.

<h4>Challenges</h4>
The team started with extra members, and ambitions were managed towards a development group of four. Two members, however, withdrew from the university, leaving Arjun Khara and Daniel Nicholson to pick up the entire project. As all other groups were by then already confirmed and working on their own projects, the two members continued development and took the additional responsibilities of programming, modelling, project management, and GitHub setup and integration. Neither has prior experience in Unreal Engine 4, and very little in the way of modelling and animation (only that which had been taught in the modules so far) so both members committed to learning the software together on weekends at Goldsmiths College. The game therefore evolved over several iterations as core knowledge of the software tools increased. Ambitions and actions were managed through meetings held and recorded twice a week between the two team members. Game development carried on over the December holidays to make up for the loss in manpower and the result was finalised in early January 2018. During this stage, the idea for a Tron-like futuristic environment was adopted and the particle systems and models were reworked to fit with the theme. Collaboration was through GitHub LFS, where large files were shared and tracked over a strictly agreed schedule to prevent overwrites and breakages.

<h4>Collaboration</h4>
The project was managed through GitHub repositories; a primary and a backup repository were established to store and track all development and changes. Given the size of the group — two members — there was no room for any major setback and the team decided to backup all major assets to a second GitHub repository, with LFS enabled for quickly uploading large files. While building a project of this scale taxed the two members, discussions and agreements were swift. GitHub Desktop was used as the go-between software to mange the growing repository and a filing system with clear nomenclatures was also established. Blueprint files, for example, were uploaded into named folders, and every blueprint was photographed and recorded as an image in the documentation section of the repository, with accompanying explanations on the build process. This documentation formed the core reference for the team to manage each stage of the game’s scope and complexity.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
The end of the first term and its games project has produced a variety of insights and dilemmas into the discipline of producing a video game. It is interesting to note the synchronicity between modelling and reality – one requires perception, and the other, vision. This raises the possibilities of modelling not just for gaming applications but also as a socially-driven engine for virtual reality, narratives of art history, sociology and the implementation of the real versus realistic dichotomy in the entertainment business as a whole. In fact it is already difficult to define where a natural environment ends and a computational system begins. Modelling is one thing, but modelling specifically for a game requires two-fold thinking, in which the considerations lie not only in the object’s form and structure, but also with its function and performance as a game asset. The application of animations (movement, scaling, burning, appearing and disappearing) requires an approach that sets one eye on the task and the other on the potential to meet future tasks. The workflow in this case includes thinking from both ends of the spectrum to necessitate minimal disruption, when transferring these assets from one medium to another. This is a new experience for the team, one which will provide ample insight and training to meet the rigours of working in the computer games industry.
