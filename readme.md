# FireFighterGame: Project Management Log
This is a group project for Arjun Khara, Daniel Nicholson, and Sarah Chalk (Goldsmiths College - University of London) 2017 â€“ 2018 for our game project: Fire Fighters.

This new repo was created to manage and refine our game project for Introduction to Modelling and Introduction to Programming. The due date for this project is 10 December 2017. Several tasks have been identified and are in the pipeline. By Thursday, 23 November 2017, Arjun and Dan will have finished modelling the fire tanks, pipe, nozzles, and gloved hands, which contribute more than 75% of the modelling assets required for this project.

For this project we will be using blueprints in Unreal to create a game where the player fights fires of different varieties (Gas, Electric, wood). The player will have to manage which extinguishing materials they have to use to put out the fire. The incorrect extinguisher will make the fire grow, the correct one will shrink until it is extinguished.

<h4>Project Team:</h4>
This project has three members. While all members' responsibilities will overlap with the others, each has been assigned a role for responsibility and oversight for this project. Role assignment is: Project Manager; Project Programmer; Project Modeller. 

The Project Manager is responsible for the overall concept of the game, keeping the project on time and within resources, overseeing the effectiveness of all project meetings and decisions, and ensuring the team meets all deliverables towards the final vision of the game.

The Project Programmer is responsible for the integrity of the codebase and debugging, and will check on the Blueprints in Unreal Engine. The Project Programmer will also be responsible for the final delivery of the code, and conduct code quality assurance audits.

The Project Modeller is responsible for the integrity of the models and assets that will be included in the game, and ensure that the models perform as required during animation and procedural development. The Project Modeller will also be responsible for the final delivery of the look and feel of the game.

Project Manager: Arjun Khara<br/>
Project Programmer: Sarah Chalk<br/>
Project Modeller: Daniel Nicholson<br/>

The project team will meet this Thursday (30 November 2017) and again on Saturday (2 December 2017) to combine all the assets we have modelled so far, and begin to integrate these into Blueprints. We are expecting all modelling to be completed by Thursday evening, 30 November 2017. Saturday, (2 December 2017) will be spent building out the main sequences of the project and for rapid prototyping of the game to address any discrepancies and concerns, as well as to evaluate what works and what needs to be changed.

Dan has figured out how to use GitLFS with GitBash to store files and upload them, in Blueprint format. Dan will teach the rest of the team how to make this work across the entire project during our weekly Saturday meeting on 2 December 2017. We will use this method together with existing procedures to begin committing and sharing our file contributions across the project.

We have managed to use Blueprints to create a number of effects for our game. Dan has worked out the AI to make objects come towards the player, which is an essential part of gameplay. Arjun has managed to work out the fire effects and colours, and integrated the dousing effects for when the object is sprayed with a suppressant. Arjun and Dan are now working off Dan's computer to integrate the separate Blueprints into a single logic flow that will control game play. We have  created a successful mock up of the environment with placeholders for the FBX assets. We are working on importing and integrating these assets, once the Blueprints codes and logic flows are in place. We are aiming to have a demo ready in time for the next presentation on Friday, 9 December 2017, where we will showcase the basic game play as an MVP, complete with dynamics, mechanics, and interaction options. We are also working on an introduction movie before the game begins, to familiarise players with the game rules and expectations.
