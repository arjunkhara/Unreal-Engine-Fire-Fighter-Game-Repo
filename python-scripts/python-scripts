INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON PROGRAMMING:
This folder contains a selection of introductory python code that will be used for both Maya, Blender, and Unreal Engine beginner-level development.

FUNCTIONS:
The command print() is a function, as evidenced by the () parentheses following the command. In Python programming, all functions are followed by a ()

MATHEMATICAL OPERATORS:
The mathematical operants in python can be entered directly and the program will run as expected. It is important to note that the numbers are different from the strings (characters such as B, r, % & ~)
2 + 2 //addition operator
2 - 2 //subtraction operator
2 * 2 //multiplication operator
2 / 2 //division operator

VARIABLES:
Variables are basic containers that contain values in the form of strings, numbers, and booleans (true and false).
apples = 10 //a variable called apples has been created and assigned a value of 10

name = Samantha //a variable called Name has been created and assigned a value of Samantha
print(name "has" apples "royal gala apples") //this will print: Samantha has 10 royal gala apples


CREATE A CHARACTER WITH INFORMATION:
In this program exercise below, I will be learning from a book tutorial how to create a character and give it some valid information to form a personality. Once this program game has been typed out, save the file then click 'Run' to play this simple game.

print("Let's create a character") //this will prompt the user to expect a game about to commence
name = input("What is your character's name?") //this will prompt the user to enter a name for the character
age = input("How old is your character?") //this will prompt the user to enter an age, which needs to be converted into a number
city = input("In which city does your character live?") //this will prompt the user to enter the name of a city
color = input("What is your character's favourite color?") //this will prompt the user to enter a color

print("Your character's name is" name) //python will print out the name given by the user
print(name "is" age "years old") //python will print out the age given by the user
print(name "lives in the magnificent city of" city) //python will print out the city given by the user
print(name"'s favourite color is" color) //python will print out the color given by the user


STRINGS AND NUMBERS:
Because there is a difference between strings and numbers, it is important to tell Python when it should treat a number as a number, and not as a default string. This is done using the integer function int()

int(age) = input("What is your age?") //int(age) tells Python that the age variable will contain a number, not a string.
