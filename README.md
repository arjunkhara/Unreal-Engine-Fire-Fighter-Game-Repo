# FireFighterGame
This is a group project for Arjun Khara, Daniel Nicholson, and Sarah Chalk (Goldsmiths College - University of London) 2017 â€“ 2018 for our game project: Fire Fighters.

This new repo was created to manage and refine our game project for Introduction to Modelling and Introduction to Programming. The due date for this project is 10 December 2017. Several tasks have been identified and are in the pipeline. By Thursday, 23 November 2017, Arjun and Dan will have finished modelling the fire tanks, pipe, nozzles, and gloved hands, which contribute more than 75% of the modelling assets required for this project.

For this project we will be using blueprints in Unreal to create a game where the player fights fires of different varieties (Gas, Electric, wood). The player will have to manage which extinguishing materials they have to use to put out the fire. The incorrect extinguisher will make the fire grow, the correct one will shrink until it is extinguished.

<h4>Project Team:</h4>
This project has three members. While all members' responsibilities will overlap with the others, each has been assigned a role for responsibility and oversight for this project. Role assignment is: Project Manager; Project Programmer; Project Modeller. 

The Project Manager is responsible for the overall concept of the game, keeping the project on time and within resources, overseeing the effectiveness of all project meetings and decisions, and ensuring the team meets all deliverables towards the final vision of the game.

The Project Programmer is responsible for the integrity of the codebase and debugging, and will check on the Blueprints in Unreal Engine. The Project Programmer will also be responsible for the final delivery of the code, and conduct code quality assurance audits.

The Project Modeller is responsible for the integrity of the models and assets that will be included in the game, and ensure that the models perform as required during animation and procedural development. The Project Modeller will also be responsible for the final delivery of the look and feel of the game.

Project Manager: Arjun Khara
Project Programmer: Sarah Chalk
Project Modeller: Daniel Nicholson
